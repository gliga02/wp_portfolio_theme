            <h3>Hi, Wordpress, My name is Djordje</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>I love mountains. I am a big-time sucker for making and capturing moments as I go. Being a
                    photographer was not something I dreamt of when I was 7. The yearning to communicate my feelings on
                    wilderness began in 2015.

            <div class="box">
                <p>A fascination for landscapes and nature, I use photography to document the world in its raw wild
                    form. Photography gives me the liberty to tell my stories visually. And it also helps me to gain
                    perspective and escape into my own dimension. My incessant hunger for perfection and details got me
                    more and more hooked to photography, and thus, I started composing moody and reflective landscapes.

            <p>Moody has always been my aesthetic, and I want to help you transform your photos and videos to achieve
                that cinematic, moody feel. If you are interested, you can find all the visual elements, that I use as
                well, on this visual store.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I hope you have fun exploring. So, don’t forget to come back for more. You can connect with me all on my socials, drop a message, and tell me about you! Let’s create.</p>
